# Todo List App written in Vue

Todo List Application built as a way for me to learn Vue. In particular, this was built at the same time as my Todo List App build in React as a way for me to understand the differences and similarities between the two javascript frameworks.

## To set up project
```
npm install
```

### To view the Todo List App
```
npm run serve
```
